# Wurdle Front End App

This is the Front End of my Wurdle app (A Wordle Clone, see original here: https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html.).

Created With Typescript and React, the app interacts with my middleware API that makes API calls to the WordsAPI(https://rapidapi.com/dpventures/api/wordsapi/) for the words and other stuff (see my backend here: https://github.com/michaelbrooks1234/Wurdle-worldle-clone-backend).

Everything is made by me, Wordle is just the inspiration I didn't copy any of their code, if I took anything directly it was probably their colors...
Functionality and styles all done by me, but my little icon svgs were done by my good friend, see him here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ephraim-ellis-246b511b8/ (and hire him too).
